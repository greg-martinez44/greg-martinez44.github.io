## Where I come from

I got my B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2017. I worked for a bit in a library. I worked for a couple of years at a facility company called JLL. We were contracted to a biomedical company called BMS. I started as a lab technician -- I cleaned out biomedical waste and clean and sanitized glassware. I also helped manage the store room. I usually finished my tasks early and had time to explore. I started learning VBA and programmed some dashboarding to help show that our new Point of Use service was working to increase researcher's time in the lab. Within the same company I moved up to Reagent Manager and then Maintance Scheduler on an initial career path towards reliability engineering. I taught myself more and more, moving on to Python and others.

I eventually moved on to Honeywell-Intelligrated as a CMMS (Computer Maintenance/Management Service) administrator. Here my job quickly evolved into BI specialist then data engineer. I pioneered automated data pipelines that were used to build reports for several different clients at once. The previous method had been automated extractions from the service's online SQL interface. I used Azure Data Factory and blob storage to run custom Azure scripts and perform ETL on unstructured API responses.

I left Honeywell-Intelligrated for an online education company called ABC Learning. I was a software developer/data engineer working mostly in PHP and Snowflake. This was my first experience with a mature CI/CD pipeline and proper software development practices, like code reviews. The pace of the job was too slow for me.

I came to Milliman looking for more opportunities to explore and learn. I dove into Databricks and cloud computing. I learned all about how Databricks manages clusters and how it connects to external storage services, like S3. I led the effort to migrate over 25 workspaces to Unity Catalog in an efficient, automated manner. I'm still learning about all kinds of things, and I hope to continue learning more.
